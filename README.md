# Stochastic-PDE-Payoff-Driven

This repository accompanies the preprint "Pattern Formation in Agent-Based and PDE Models for Evolutionary Games with Payoff-Driven Motion",by Tianyong Yao, Chenning Xu and Daniel B. Cooney. It includes all of the scripts used to generate all of the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into two folders: MATLAB Scripts, which generates the PDE figures and executable using MATLAB R2024a, and Python Scripts, which generates the stochastic figures and runs on Python >=3.7

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.
