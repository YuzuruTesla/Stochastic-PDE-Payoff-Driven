# Stochastic-PDE-Payoff-Driven

This repository accompanies the preprint "Pattern Formation in Agent-Based and PDE Models for Evolutionary Games with Payoff-Driven Motion",by Tianyong Yao, Chenning Xu and Daniel B. Cooney. It includes all of the scripts used to generate all of the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into four folders: MATLAB Scripts and Python Scripts. All of the scripts can be run using MATLAB_R2024a.

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.
