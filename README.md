# Stochastic-PDE-Payoff-Driven

This repository accompanies the preprint "Pattern Formation in Agent-Based and PDE Models for Evolutionary Games with Payoff-Driven Motion", by Tianyong Yao, Chenning Xu and Daniel B. Cooney. It includes all scripts used to generate the figures in the paper.

The repository consists of two folders: MATLAB Scripts, which generates the PDE figures and executable using MATLAB R2024a, and Python Scripts, which generates the stochastic figures and runs on Python >=3.7

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to reproduce each of them.
